# while it coninuous in iteration until the condition is false

#e.g.
a=8
#while  a>5:
#    print(1) # it continue run until the condition is not false so we need to make it as it become false sometime


#other example we can take

a=0
while a<10:
    a=a+1
    print(a) # it works for definte time as once a become equal or greater than that
