#tuple is defined as list but the difference is it is defined is in small bracket
#while it is immutable that means it is doesnt change at later

temp =(23,45,34,67)
print(temp)
print(type(temp))
#temp = temp.append(56) it is not append as we know that it is immutable


#create complex dictionary let suppose the it makes through the tupples
