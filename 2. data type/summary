Summary: Integers, Floats, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, dir, help
In this section you learned that:

Integers are for representing whole numbers:

1. rank = 10
2. eggs = 12
3. people = 3

Floats represent continuous values:

1. temperature = 10.2
2. rainfall = 5.98
3. elevation = 1031.88
4. Strings represent any text:

message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
 1. name = "John"
2.serial = "R001991981SW"

Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:

1. members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
2. pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]

Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:

1. phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
2. volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}

Keys of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.keys()

Values of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.values()

Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:

1. vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
2. one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

To find out what attributes a type has:

1. dir(str)
2. dir(list)
3. dir(dict)

To find out what Python builtin functions there are:
1. dir(__builtins__)

Documentation for a Python command can be found with:

1. help(str)
2. help(str.replace)
3. help(dict.values)
